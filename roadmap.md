# 🚀 FAANG ML Mastery Journey

A 12-week, end-to-end Machine Learning roadmap covering:

- Math foundations
- ML algorithms from scratch
- Optimization & regularization
- Model selection & evaluation
- Real-world ML projects
- Production-ready thinking

## 📌 Structure

- `roadmap.md` → Full learning plan
- `week-XX-*` → Weekly execution (code + notes + projects)
- `blogs/` → Concept explanations & reflections

## 🎯 Goal

Build **deep ML intuition + strong implementation skills** aligned with FAANG-level expectations.
